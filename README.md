# bulma-admin-laravel
a template of few blank Admin Template with Blade Template Ready, built using Bulma CSS Framework and Font Awesome. No JQuery at All. 

# Background
a few months ago a friends of mine ask me if I can make him a Web template which use an JS Framework, and without JQuery. 
From those, I then realize that: 
1st. I'm not a web designer. 
2nd. I just realize that many people hate JQuery (so is Bootstrap which use it)
3rd. Many now use Laravel. (including me)
so here I try to build this template as minimalist as possible. 

# Ingredient
this is a folder consisted of several .blade.php file which you can use. Just create your new blade.php file then extends one of layout.blade.php you want to use.
